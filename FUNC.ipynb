    "**FUNC** (after Gowers): The Frankl union-closed sets conjecture (in any family $\\mathcal{F}$ of $n$ sets that's\n",
    "1) closed under unions and\n",
    "2) not just the empty set,\n",
    "there's an element that's in $\\geq n/2$ sets.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's \"harder\" when these families include $\\emptyset$ - any counterexample without $\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{F}$ is still a counterexample when you add in $\\emptyset$, and if the conjecture is true for families that include $\\emptyset$, it's true for all of them - we'll assume these families always include the empty set unless otherwise noted. It makes some of the lattice and algebraic ideas cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**universe** (after Bruhn & Schaudt): Everything that appears in some set in the family $\\mathcal{F}$. Only makes sense to count the elements that actually appear. I'll write them as digits when there's $\\leq 10$ of them, and $a_{i}$ otherwise, sometimes as $x,y,z$ if I'm talking about arbitrary ones. Sometimes **ground set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**element** (after Bruhn & Schaudt): Members of the universe/ground set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**abundant element** (after Bruhn & Schaudt): An element that is in $\\geq n/2$ of the sets. FUNC says every family has an abundant element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**is Frankl** (me): Sometimes it gets tiring to type \"has an abundant element\", so I'll say $\\mathcal{F}$ is Frankl if it has an abundant element. (This is not awesome terminology - the name doesn't suggest what it means, and could reasonably be used to mean \"is union-closed and contains more than just $\\emptyset$\" - and so I'll only use this where I think formality is not that helpful.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**n, m** (after Bruhn & Schaudt): This can get ambiguous so I won't use it without extra clarification, but when both $n$ and $m$ are in use, $n$ will be used for the number of sets in the family and $m$ will be used for the number of elements in the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **isomorphism** $\\phi$ between two union-closed families $\\mathcal{F}, \\mathcal{G}$ (me) is what you'd expect: $\\phi: \\mathcal{F} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}$ is a bijection that preserves the union operation: for $A,B \\in \\mathcal{F}, \\phi(A \\cup B) = \\phi(A) \\cup \\phi(B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**separating** (after Bruhn and Schaudt): $\\mathcal{F}$ is separating if, for every distinct pair of elements, there exists a set in the family that contains exactly one of the pair. Two elements $x,y$ are separating if there's a set that contains exactly one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this doesn't mean that you can find sets containing exactly one of either of the pair. $\\{\\emptyset, \\{1\\}, \\{12\\}\\}$ is separating even though 2 never shows up without 1 around.\n",
    "\n",
    "**non-redundant** (me): A strengthening of separating. An element $x$ in the universe of $\\mathcal{F}$ is **redundant** if the map $\\mathcal{F} \\mapsto \\mathcal{F'}$ that removes $x$ from every set in $\\mathcal{F}$ in which it appears is an isomorphism. A family $\\mathcal{F}$ is **non-redundant** if there are no redundant elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**independent** (me): A different strengthening of separating. Two elements $x,y$ in the universe of $\\mathcal{F}$ are independent if there exists a set in $\\mathcal{F}$ that contain $x$ and not $y$ and a set that contains $y$ and not $x$. The whole family $\\mathcal{F}$ is independent if there are such sets for every pair. $x$ is **dependent** on $y$ if whenever $x$ appears in a set, so does $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**reducible** (after Acquaah): If for union-closed family $\\mathcal{F} = \\bigcup F_{i}$ there's another family $\\mathcal{G} = \\bigcup G_{i}$ with the same number of sets, and each $G_{i} \\subseteq F_{i}$, and not every $G_{i} = F_{i}$, then we say $\\mathcal{F}$ is **reducible** to $\\mathcal{G}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{F}$ is **irreducible** (Acquaah) if no such $\\mathcal{G}$ exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**basis**: A set $A$ is in the basis of $\\mathcal{F}$ if you can't build it out of any other sets in the family: $B \\cup C = A$ only if $B=C=A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some writers are drawn to using \"prime\" here, but I don't think that's helpful - most of the powerful features and difficulties of prime-ness don't seem to hold. You can build a family where a set that looks like anything is a basis set. And it's not very deep to tell if a set is in the basis. The strong structure comes in when looking at what else can be in the basis at the same time, and when different combinations of basis elements give identical results, so basis seems like the right concept.\n",

A hint this is an unsound direction is that it smells a little like classifying groups, a monster project, except it's lattices, of which there are a ton more and which have less structure. That's not completely convincing to me, though, the characterization doesn't have to be complete to be useful, it just has to say something interesting about abundant elements or about the structure of a counterexample.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Preliminary:** $\\phi: \\mathcal{F} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}$, a function between two union-closed families $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{G}$, is a **renaming** if it's given by a bijection between the universe of $\\mathcal{F}$ and the universe of $\\mathcal{G}$. Renamings are isomorphisms. (Renamings don't necessarily have to be between non-redundant families.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemma:** Any isomorphism between non-redundant families is a renaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:** Let $\\phi: \\mathcal{F} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}$ be an isomorphism between non-redundant families $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{G}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\mathcal{F}$ is non-redundant, for every element $x$ in the universe of $\\mathcal{F}$, we can choose from $\\mathcal{F}$ a pair of sets $A, A \\cup \\{x\\}$ that differ only by whether they include $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at $\\phi(A)$ and $\\phi(A \\cup \\{x\\})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\phi$ preserves unions, $\\phi(A) \\cup \\phi(A \\cup \\{x\\}) = \\phi(A \\cup (A \\cup \\{x\\}) = \\phi(A \\cup \\{x\\})$, so $\\phi(A) \\subseteq \\phi(A \\cup \\{x\\})$. Because $\\phi$ is 1-1, the containment is strict: $\\phi(A) \\subset \\phi(A \\cup \\{x\\})$. That means $\\phi(A \\cup \\{x\\})$ contains some additional element or elements that $\\phi(A)$ doesn't. Let's call that additional stuff $\\Phi(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can show that, for all $x$ in the universe of $\\mathcal{F}$,\n",
    "1. $\\Phi(x)$ appears in $\\phi(B)$ exactly when $x$ appears in $B$\n",
    "2. $\\Phi(x) = \\Phi(y)$ only when $x = y$\n",
    "3. $\\Phi(x)$ has just one element in it\n",
    "4. $\\Phi$ is onto with respect to the universe of $\\mathcal{G}$\n",
    "\n",
    "...then $\\Phi$ is our bijection between the universe of $\\mathcal{F}$ and the universe of $\\mathcal{G}$, and $\\phi$ is a renaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\Phi(x)$ appears in $\\phi(B)$ when and only when $x$ appears in $B$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x$ is in $B$, then, using the $A$ we picked to define $\\Phi$, $B \\cup A = B \\cup (A \\cup \\{x\\})$. But then $\\phi(B) \\cup \\phi(A \\cup \\{x\\})$, which contains everything in $\\Phi(x)$, equals $\\phi(B) \\cup \\phi(A)$. Since nothing in $\\Phi(x)$ is contained in $\\phi(A)$, that means that everything in $\\Phi(x)$ must be contained in $\\phi(B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if everything in $\\Phi(x)$ appears in $\\phi(B)$, then $\\phi(B) \\cup \\phi(A) = \\phi(B) \\cup \\phi(A \\cup \\{x\\})$, which means that $\\phi(B \\cup A) = \\phi(B \\cup (A \\cup \\{x\\})$. Since $\\phi$ is 1-1, $B \\cup A = B \\cup (A \\cup \\{x\\})$, which since $x$ is not in $A$, means that $x$ must be in $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $\\Phi(x) = \\Phi(y)$ only when $x = y$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\Phi(x) = \\Phi(y)$, then by 1., $x$ would appear in $B \\in \\mathcal{F}$ when and only when $y$ does. Since $\\mathcal{F}$ is non-redundant, it's separating, so $x = y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $\\Phi(x)$ has just one element in it\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\mathcal{G}$ is non-redundant, for every element in the universe of $\\mathcal{G}$, we can find a pair of sets $C, D$ that differ only by that element. So in the same way we formed $\\Phi$ from $\\phi$, we can form $\\Phi'$ from $\\phi^{-1}$. By 1. above, whenever $x$ appears in $B$, for each element $x'$ of $\\Phi(x)$, $\\Phi'(x')$ appears in $B$. Since $\\mathcal{F}$ is separating, that can only be true if $\\Phi'(x') = x$ for each $x'$ - so by 2., there's in fact exactly one distinct $x'$ in $\\Phi(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. $\\Phi$ covers the universe of $\\mathcal{G}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an $x'$ in the universe of $\\mathcal{G}$, $\\Phi'(x') = x$ is an element in the universe of $\\mathcal{F}$ with $\\Phi(x) = x'$.\n",
